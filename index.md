## Overview

Rainbow Warrior Connection is an application where UH students can post their skills online and look for jobs in the industry they want to work for. 
While companies can post their job listings, hiring positions, location, salary, etc. so students can see what they are signing up for. For this application,
we are looking to provide access to companies and students with their own separate pages. Students will be able to browse and filter out jobs while companies can
update their listings.

## Reviews

### MB Technologies
Web links and interfaces are not working smoothly. Browse students interface is now working and stuck on the login to your account. Add job tab cannot submit does not input to database. Browse Companies interface looks nice and seems to work well. Company Home fills in submitted works but does not clear after submission.

Overall the web site does not have instructions or description on the purpose of the site. Site could use a FAQ page for instructions or answers. Graphics seem nice and interface layout is decent. The main page logo graphic is a bit too big for the page and should be smaller..  Website still needs a lot of work to be considered usable.  
  
### Clara
- A lot of emphasis on Kermit, makes it look like a mascot 
- Picture url is a little troublesome, uploading files of picture can be an improvement 
- Have a different texture on the side of browse students/ companies
- Have a filter for browse companies

### Justin
- Interests in alphabetical order 
- The website is easy and simple
- Doesn't look professional/ interesting
- Can include more things to filter by (experience, other things)  

### V (Name kept anonymous)
- They layout is organized and is easy to navigate.
- Everything is on the website for a purpose. No unnecessary bells and whistles. Straightforward website.
- Color choice is pleasing to the eye.  

### B (Name kept anonymous)
- Browse pages look too empty
- Website looks straightforward/ not complicated
- Big whitespace on bottom of some pages looks bad

## Thank you for the feedback 
We will use this to improve on the website and we appreciate the time you have taken to try our website out. From these reviews, it seems like we need to fix some links and better improve some page ui. Another main issue is to make it easier to upload photos.

## overview

Rainbow Warrior Connection is an application where UH students can post their skills online and look for jobs in the industry they want to work for. 
While companies can post their job listings, hiring positions, location, salary, etc. so students can see what they are signing up for. For this application,
we are looking to provide access to companies and students with their own separate pages. Students will be able to browse and filter out jobs while companies can
update their listings.
